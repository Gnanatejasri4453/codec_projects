📉 Customer Churn Prediction – README
📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning. Churn refers to customers who stop using a company's service. By identifying these customers in advance, businesses can take proactive steps to retain them, improve satisfaction, and reduce loss in revenue.

🎯 Objective
The main objective of this task is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a customer is likely to churn or stay based on their historical behavior and demographic information. This helps companies make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used contains customer records and their churn status. Each record includes:

Customer details: ID, gender, age, contract type, tenure, etc.

Service information: internet usage, payment method, tech support, etc.

Label: Whether the customer has churned (Yes) or not (No)

This data enables the training of a supervised machine learning model to learn patterns related to customer behavior and loyalty.

⚙️ Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Data is cleaned by handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical format, and normalizing the features for consistent model performance.

Feature Selection
The most relevant features influencing churn are selected using correlation analysis or feature importance techniques to improve model accuracy and reduce noise.

Model Training
A classification model is trained using a portion of the dataset. Common algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods such as random forest.

Model Evaluation
The model’s performance is measured using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset.

📊 Results
The trained model successfully identifies customers at risk of churning with high accuracy. Businesses can use this insight to implement retention strategies such as offering discounts, personalized communication, or service improvements.

🔍 Key Learnings
The impact of data quality and preprocessing on model effectiveness

Understanding customer behavior through data analysis

How machine learning can support business decision-making and customer relationship management

🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrating the model into a CRM dashboard for real-time predictions

Using advanced models such as XGBoost or neural networks for better accuracy

Including customer sentiment data from reviews or feedback
